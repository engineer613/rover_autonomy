 ## High Level System Architecture for ROS2-based Autonomous Rover
 High level overview of ROS2-based modular architecture for autonomous rover. Includes ROS2 Lifecycle nodes for localization, waypoint following, real-time control, and telemetry streaming over long-range radio to an off-board GUI. Detailed documentation describing the ROS2 interfaces (messages, services & actions) and data flow and logic in each of the packages is in the works.
